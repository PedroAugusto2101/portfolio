## ðŸ“š Learnings

Throughout this guided project focused on exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling, I deepened my understanding of important data science concepts and Python tools, especially the Seaborn visualization library. Below are the key learnings and insights I gained:

### 1. Exploratory Data Visualization with Seaborn

- **`jointplot`**:  
  Combines a scatter plot and histograms (or KDE) to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables along with their marginal distributions.  
  Example:

  ```python
  sns.jointplot(data=df, x='feature1', y='target', kind='scatter')
  ```

  This helps in quickly identifying correlation, trends, and possible outliers.

- **`hexplot` (using `jointplot(kind='hex')`)**:  
  Useful for large datasets where scatter points overlap. It bins data points into hexagons colored by density, revealing data concentration areas.  
  Example:

  ```python
  sns.jointplot(data=df, x='feature1', y='target', kind='hex')
  ```

- **`pairplot`**:  
  Creates pairwise scatter plots for all combinations of variables in a dataset, along with histograms on the diagonal, providing a comprehensive overview of relationships and distributions.  
  Example:

  ```python
  sns.pairplot(df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'target']])
  ```

- **`lmplot`**:  
  Plots data points along with a linear regression line and confidence interval, which is great for visually assessing linear relationships.  
  Example:
  ```python
  sns.lmplot(data=df, x='feature1', y='target')
  ```

### 2. Data Structuring: Understanding `X` and `y`

- The use of uppercase `X` and lowercase `y` follows a common mathematical and programming convention in machine learning and statistics.
- `X` is uppercase because it usually represents a **matrix** (a 2D array) containing multiple features (independent variables). Matrices are typically denoted by uppercase letters.
- `y` is lowercase because it usually represents a **vector** (a 1D array) of target values (dependent variable), and vectors are commonly denoted by lowercase letters.
- This notation helps clearly differentiate the shape and role of the inputs (`X`) versus the outputs (`y`) when building and training models.

### 3. Residuals and Their Importance

- **Definition:**  
  Residuals are the differences between observed values and predicted values from the model:  
  \[
  \text{Residual} = y*{\text{real}} - y*{\text{predicted}}
  \]

- **Example:**  
  If the model predicts a house price of $300,000 but the actual price is $320,000, the residual is:  
  \[
  320,000 - 300,000 = 20,000
  \]

- **Why analyze residuals?**
  - Residuals help evaluate model accuracy and assumptions.
  - In linear regression, residuals should ideally be normally distributed with a mean near zero.
  - Patterns or trends in residuals (e.g., funnel shape, autocorrelation) suggest problems like heteroscedasticity or model misspecification.

### 4. Model Validation and Interpretation

- Validating the model fit involves checking residual plots and statistical metrics to ensure assumptions hold.
- Interpreting regression results critically allows identifying if transformations or more complex models are needed.
- Understanding the limits of linear models guides better decision-making and model improvement.
